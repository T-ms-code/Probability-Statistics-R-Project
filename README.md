**Description + Used Concepts**    
The project was created by a team formed by me and three other students. I led the team, and the project had three main goals:  
1)To calculate the probabilities (cumulative distribution function - CDF) associated with events/activities modeled by an exponential distribution;   
2)To create a Shiny application (Welcome to Shiny) that represents the PMF/PDF for certain random variables and calculates the mean and variance for others;  
3)To estimate parameters using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Method of Moments (MoM) for a given PDF/PMF.   
All implementations were done in R. My work was 3.
